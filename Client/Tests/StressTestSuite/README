CMS DLS/LFC Stress Test Suite Version 1.0

This is a short guide to setup the parameters used for the Stress-Test.
Such parameters are in the file parameters.py:

- threadNum (int)
	the number of threads used during each phase.

- clientDir (str)
	the location of the dls client commands

- nBlocks (int)
	number of blocks for each file
- nReplicas (int)
	number of replicas for each fileblock

- paretoK (int) and paretoAlpha (float)
	these values are used to model the clients arrival queue.
	paretoK should be smaller or equals to threadNum, while paretoAlpha
	is the hard-tail parameter for the distribution.Pay attention tuning it,
	it could generate REALLY long wait time.

- magThread (int), magBlocks (int), magReplicas (int), magParetoK (float)
	multiplication coefficients of the previously described parameters. 
	The are called by the most stressing phase (Magnitude Test), tune them
	carefully.

- magBlockPreambleLen (int) and magSePreambleLen (int)
	padding fields sizes. The set values are qualitative, as soon as I will
	know the actual LFC field sizes I will fix such values.

- randRepetitions (int) and randFactor (int)
	coefficients for the random test. They act mainly on the number of random tests
	and on the range of the random parameters.

- The following parameters act on the probabilistic automaton used to perform
	user simulation test.

	-userBound (int) 
		the length of the automaton action chain
	- userInitStateP (array of float)
		the probability vector for the initial automaton move.
		The sum of the components has to be 1.0
	
	- userMarkov (6*6 float matrix )
		the transposed markov chain for the automaton.
		The sum of each row has to be 1.0
		The used values are euristics but without any log from LFC I can't say 
		which are the frequencies of the actions.
