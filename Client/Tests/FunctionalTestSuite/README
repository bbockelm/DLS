Introduction
------------
The DLS Client Functional Test Suite is a suite to check that the DLS
Client API and CLI works as expected. In principle, for each DLS
implementation the CLI and API could work slightly different (some offer
more functionalities than others), so there can be different modules
which contain classes implementing tests (in the unittest framework).

For each test there is a runnable script that executes the different
tests. Usually, an optional additional argument may be used to execute a
desired subset of the tests (default is to execute all of them). Please
execute each script with the "-h" option to obtain more information.

NOTE: In the case of the LFC tests, they rely on a clean directory in
the DLS, which they use and clean at the end (without removing the
directory itself).

In what follows we describe existing tests.


DlsApiTest
----------
General test of the API for the DLS implementations (it should work with
LFC or MySQL implementations). It does not include LFC-only capabilities
like attributes or transactions.

If everything is all right, this test version should produce no error with
latest DLS API implementations.

Main files are:
 DlsApiTest.py: contains the tests and is runnable
 DlsApiTest.conf: example conf file for previous script

In addition, you need, of course, the DLS Client API code (python modules).

For LFC API testing, you also need standard globus security installed, the
lfc.py library, a valid grid proxy and access to a LFC-based DLS server.


DlsLfcApiTest
-------------
Test of the API for the LFC-based DLS implementation. It includes some 
LFC-only capabilities like attributes support or transactions.

If everything is all right, this test version should produce no error with
latest LFC-based DLS API implementation.

Main files are:
 DlsLfcApiTest.py: contains the tests and is runnable
 DlsLfcApiTest.conf: example conf file for previous script

In addition, you need, of course, the DLS Client API code (python modules).

You also need standard globus security installed, the lfc.py library, a
valid grid proxy and access to a LFC-based DLS server.


DlsLfcCliTest
-------------
Test of the CLI for the LFC-based DLS implementation. Since the CLI uses
the API, this test also tests the API indirectly (though not in a 
comprenhensive way).

If everything is all right, this test version should produce no error with
latest DLS Client.

Main files are:
 DlsLfcCliTest.py: contains the tests and is runnable
 DlsLfcCliTest.conf: example conf file for previous script
 anto_utils.py, lfc_del*, lfc-del*: utilities used by the script

In addition, you need, of course, the DLS Client API code (python modules)
and the command line tools (python scripts).

You also need standard globus security installed, the lfc.py library,
a valid grid proxy and access to a LFC-based DLS server.
