Introduction
------------
The DLS Client Functional Test Suite is a suite to check that the DLS
Client API and CLI works as expected. In principle, for each DLS
implementation the CLI and API could work slightly different (some offer
more functionalities than others), so there can be different modules
which contain classes implementing tests (in the unittest framework).

The tests should create their own test area in the DLS and clean 
everything afterwards.

In what follows we describe existing tests.


DlsLfcCliTest
-------------
Test of the CLI for the LFC-based DLS implementation. Since the CLI uses
the API, this test also tests the API indirectly (though not in a 
comprenhensive way).

This test version should produce no error with DLS Client with tag
DLS_V0_0_2.

Main files are:
 DlsLfcCliTest.py: contains the tests and is runnable
 DlsLfcCliTest.conf: example conf file for previous script
 anto_utils.py, lfc_del*, lfc-del*: utilities used by the script

In addition, you need, of course the DLS Client code (dlsApi.py,
dlsLfcApi.py, dlsClient.py, dlsDliClient.py and dls-* commands) and the
DLI client code (dliClient.py, dliClient_types.py).


This test version should produce no error with DLS Client with tag
DLS_V0_0_2.
You may need to set your PYTHONPATH env var to read the previous files.
You also need standard globus security installed, the lfc.py library,
a valid grid proxy and access to a LFC-based DLS server.
