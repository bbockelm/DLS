# DliClient v 0.1

This DliClient is based on the ZSI library to access web services from python.
In this repository we include a (working) tarball with ZSI code, but ZSI is a
different project, whose code (and more information, etc.) can be obtained from:
http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/.

Other files here contained:

  dliClient_types.py:  some classes required to be able to talk to the DLI web server
  dliClient.py:  DliClient class, main API to be used
  dli-list:   tool that uses dli_client.py to query the DLI interface

If you just copy everything to the same dir, untar the ZSI.tar.gz, and execute:
   ./dli-list <lfn>
You should get the locations.

If you are not in the same dir where ZSI resides (or the dli_* files), then you need
to setup PYTHONPATH. For the rest, only PyXML is required; no globus, no certificates,
no LCG/LFC libraries... are needed.

Right now (and to be improved), the default DLI endpoint (http://lfc-cms.cern.ch:8085),
but that can be overriden when using the API.
